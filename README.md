# NLP_Assignment_2

**Content warning: this assignment contains an analysis of offensive language examples.**

In this assignment, we will work with the OLIDv1 dataset, which contains 13,240 annotated 
tweets for offensive language detection. This dataset was used in the SemEval 2019 shared 
task on offensive language detection (OffensEval 2019).

We will focus on Subtask A (identify whether a tweet is offensive or not). We preprocessed the 
dataset so that label ‘1’ corresponds to offensive messages (‘OFF’ in the dataset description 
paper) and ‘0’ to non-offensive messages (‘NOT’ in the dataset description paper).

You submit a pdf of this document, the format should not be changed.
Your analyses should be conducted using python 3.8.
You submit a zip-file containing all your code.
